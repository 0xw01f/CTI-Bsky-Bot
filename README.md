The **Threat Intelligence Bluesky Bot** is a fork of the [original Threat Intelligence Teams Bot](https://github.com/JMousqueton/CTI-MSTeams-Bot) created by **Julien Mousqueton**. This bot now publishes threat intelligence updates on **Bluesky** instead of Microsoft Teams, and is designed to run periodically to check for new updates from various cybersecurity sources.

> The bot fetches updates from various clearnet domains, ransomware threat actor domains, and other cybersecurity-related feeds. It checks for new updates every 30 minutes and posts them on **Bluesky**.

## Credit

This project was initially created by **Julien Mousqueton**. I have modified it to fit my own use case, switching the integration from Microsoft Teams to **Bluesky**. Special thanks to Julien for the original work and to everyone who has supported and contributed to this project.

Thanks also to the cybersecurity community for providing the threat intelligence feeds that make this bot useful.
